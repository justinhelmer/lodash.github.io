The `GitHub Release Manager` automates the process of building a website and documenting `APIs` for any `GitHub` project. With a **_single command_**, you can run _any_ or _all_ of the following:

1. Download all recent releases ([tags](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/tags/)) by fetching them via the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
2. Parse the [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) documentation of all latest releases and generate a custom [JSDoc template](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-default-template.html) for navigating any or all available releases.
3. Run a code quality check using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started), by simply creating an `ESLint` configuration file.
4. Run any custom defined `test` routine by running [npm test](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/test).
5. Use [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) to build a full-fledged website from [markdown](https://github.com/chjj/marked) files, [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates, [libSass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass), and more.
6. Deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Much of this is done through a single [vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs) file stream (built on top of [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), for maximum peformance. It also provides an interface for running [custom build operations](#custom-build-tasks) and/or validating/preventing the build.

</p>

Additionally, `GRM` allows you to [serve](#grm-serve1) the website for debugging / development using [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/).

## Installation

`GitHub Release Manager` (`GRM`) can be installed _locally_ or _globally_, and includes both a [node interface](#node-interface) and a command-line interface ([CLI](#cli)). It also includes a [CLI adapter](#cli-adapter) to easily integrate the [node interface](#node-interface) into any existing `node`-based command-line program.

### Install globally

```bash
$ npm install --global gh-release-manager   # avalable everywhere 
```

### Install locally

```bash
$ npm install --save gh-release-manager

# optionally link the script to node_modules/gh-release-manager
# (does NOT install the module globally)
$ cd node_modules/gh-release-manager && npm link
```

## Usage

There are **three** ways to interface with the `GitHub Release Manager`:

1. Using the [command-line interface](#cli)
2. Using the [node interface](#node-interface)
3. Using the [CLI adapter](#cli-adapter)

There is also a long list of [options](#common-options) that can be used to customize the behavior.

## CLI

The package name (`gh-release-manager`) is also the command when using the `CLI`. However, `GRM` also uses [node-alias](https://github.com/justinhelmer/node-alias) to set up a _short_ command, `grm`.

Additionally, each [option](#common-options) has a [short option format](#short-option-format) that is compatible with the `CLI`.

### Using the CLI

Display the contents of the manual:

```bash
$ grm help
```

Do it all in one go:

```bash
$ grm
```

Or, run one of the [sub commands](#sub-commands).

### Sub commands

Although it is often most convenient to [do it all in one go](#usage), there may be a use case that involves running the steps individually (i.e. debugging, [serving](#grm-serve1), etc). For that reason, `GRM` is a collection of sub commands (or just simply `"commands"`). By default, if no `[command]` is specified, [grm-release(1)](#grm-release1) is run.

Every command has a `help` file. Simply run:

```bash
$ grm help [command]
```

This will display the information about the command, including all of the available [options](#common-options) for that command.

#### grm-build(1)

> Use [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) to build a full-fledged website from [markdown](https://github.com/chjj/marked) files, [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates, [libSass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass), and more.

```bash
$ grm build
```

**available [options](#common-options):** [_opts_](#opts), [_build_](#build), [_quiet_](#quiet), [_urlBase_](#urlbase), [_verbose_](#verbose)

`GRM` includes a bundle of tools for dynamically building a website; similar to popular tools like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). However, the toolset provided in `GRM` is much more powerful, as it is built on top of [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/). It runs purely in `node`, so there is no extra `Ruby` dependency. It also integrates seamlessly with the `vinyl` pipeline for exceptional performance.

To take advantage of this toolset, get familiar with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) which is used as the templating engine, and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) which is the included `CSS` preprocessor.

Then, all you need to do is to start creating files according to the expected directory structure:

```
- node_modules
    - gh-release-manager    # this module
- source                    # any .md files can be placed in source/**
    - css                   # all scss files go here
    - layouts               # all handlebars templates go here
    - partials              # all handlebars partials go here
- .eslintrc.js              # see grm-lint(1)
- grm.opts                  # see grm.opts()
- grm.metadata.json         # global template metadata (see below)
```

The `markdown` files will also be parsed for [YAML Front Matter](https://github.com/dworthen/js-yaml-front-matter), and the data is passed to the template and made available to `handlebars`. Additionally, the following `Front Matter` attribute(s) have special meaning:

```
---
layout: page.html           # from source/layouts - defaults to page.html
---
```

Finally, the following data is made available to all `Handlebars` templates:

- `content` - Contains the [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)-generated `HTML`. Should use triple-brackets (i.e. `{{{content}}}`) to [escape HTML](http://handlebarsjs.com/#html-escaping).
- `site` - A merged object containing:
    - All global template [metadata](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-metadata) read from the `grm.metadata.json` file in the _project root_.
    - `urlBase`, if set by [options.urlBase](#urlbase). Useful for generating url prefixes, i.e. `{{site.urlBase}}/images.png`
    
    > If the `grm.metadata.json` file does not exist, and [options.urlBase](#urlbase) is not set, `site` will be `undefined`.

Example `grm.metadata.json`:

```js
{
  "title": "Lodash.com"
}
```

...and an example usage, in a custom `head.html`:

```html
<!-- If 'title' is set in the 'Front Matter' for the page,
    use it and the global 'site.title' from 'grm.metadata.json' -->

<title>{{#if title}}{{title}} | {{site.title}}{{else}}{{site.title}}{{/if}}</title>
```

Also, [custom build](#custom-build-tasks) tasks can be automated and included in the pipeline when `build` is run.

See the [lodash.github.io](https://github.com/justinhelmer/lodash.github.io) project for an example implementation of `gh-release-manager`.

#### grm-deploy(1)

> Deploy the build directory to `gh-pages`.

```bash
$ grm deploy
```

**available [options](#common-options):** [_opts_](#opts), [_quiet_](#quiet), [_verbose_](#verbose)

The final step of the [release](#grm-release1) routine. Uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment. Pushes the `build/` folder to `gh-pages`. Assumes the _current working directory_ is a `Git` repository, and uses its remote url.

#### grm-download(1)

> Download recent releases via the [GitHub Tags API](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/tags/).

```bash
$ grm download
```

**available [options](#common-options):** [_opts_](#opts), [_keep_](#keep), [_lib_](#lib), [_quiet_](#quiet), [_repo_](#repo), [_top_](#top), [_verbose_](#verbose)

The [[top]](#top) most recent releases are fetched from [[repo]](#repo), then the file located at [[lib]](#lib) (relative to the repo) is stored in [[keep]](#keep) (if provided).

- If `[keep]` is not provided, `GRM` will store the downloaded files in a temporary directory that is deleted after success or failure.
- If `[lib]` is not provided, `GRM` will assume the file to be stored is located at `[project root]/index.js`.
- If `[repo]` is not provided, `GRM` will prompt for input in the format `[org/repo]`.
- If `[top]` is not provided, `GRM` will fetch the default number of releases (determined by the `GitHub API`).

#### grm-jsdoc(1)

> Parse JSDoc headers for locally-downloaded releases.

```bash
$ grm jsdoc
```

**available [options](#common-options):** [_opts_](#opts), [_keep_](#keep), [_quiet_](#quiet), [_verbose_](#verbose)

The `JavaScript` files located at [[keep]](#keep) are parsed for [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) comment blocks.

> When running [release](#grm-release1), if `[keep]` is not set, files are stored in a `tmp` directory and parsed from there.

Supports all `JSDoc` [JSON configuration](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html). `GRM` will look in the _current working directory_ for a file called `jsdoc.conf.json` and inherit the provided configuration. By default, the following options are set:

- `configure` - Points to the project root as the location of [jsdoc.conf.json](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html).
- `destination` - Points to `build/docs/[release]`.
- `encoding` - UTF8.
- `recurse` - Generates documentation recursively through the releases (`[keep]`) directory.

#### grm-lint(1)

> Run code quality check using ESLint.

```bash
$ grm lint
```

**available [options](#common-options):** [_opts_](#opts), [_quiet_](#quiet), [_verbose_](#verbose)

When this command is run, the `GRM` will look for an [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) configuration file in the _current working directory_. It will accept any valid `ESLint` configuration file:

- .eslintrc.js
- .eslintrc.yaml
- .eslintrc.yml
- .eslintrc.json
- .eslintrc

If the file does not exist, a warning will be displayed (if [verbosity](#verbose) is high enough), but the task will not exit with an error.

It then runs `ESLint` with the supplied configuration against **all** `JavaScript` files with the exception of the `node_modules/` folder.

#### grm-release(1)

> Do it all in one go.

```bash
$ grm release
$ grm # alias
```

**[all common options](#common-options),** plus [_deploy_](#deploy).

As mentioned earlier, `grm-release(1)` is the default command run when no [sub command](#sub-command) is specified. This will run all of the sub commands, with the exception of [grm-serve(1)](#grm-serve1) in the following order:

1. [grm-download(1)](#grm-download1)
2. [grm-jsdoc(1)](#grm-jsdoc1)
3. [grm-test(1)](#grm-test1)
4. [grm-lint(1)](#grm-lint1)
5. [grm-build(1)](#grm-build1)
6. [grm-deploy(1)](#grm-deploy1) _can be skipped using the [deploy](#deploy) option_

#### grm-serve(1)

> Serve the website for debugging / development using [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/).

```bash
$ grm serve
```

**available [options](#common-options):** [_opts_](#opts), [_port_](#port), [_quiet_](#quiet), [_urlBase_](#urlbase), [_verbose_](#verbose)

Launchs a static server with [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/), and re-builds/re-loads when necessary by using [gaze](https://github.com/shama/gaze) to observe file changes. Additionally uses [opn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn) to automatically launch a browser to the base url.

If only making changes to `.scss` files, the new styles will be injected automatically and the browser will not refresh; the changes will be seen immediately. If making changes to `HTML` / `markdown` files, the browser will automatically refresh once the full [build](#grm-build1) of the website completes.

- If `[port]` is not provided, the website will be served on port `3000`.
- If `[urlBase]` is set, the server will alias all requests by removing [urlBase](#urlbase) when doing a static file lookup. Also [opens](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn) the browser to the base URL. 

#### grm-test(1)

> Run a custom `test` routine using `npm test`, if it exists

```bash
$ grm test
```

**available [options](#common-options):** [_opts_](#opts), [_quiet_](#quiet), [_verbose_](#verbose)

Simply runs `npm test` with [run-script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script). The one main difference is that `grm test` captures any errors that result from the `test` script not existing in `package.json`.

Useful when run as a part of a larger pipeline, i.e. when running the [release](#grm-release1) command.

## Node interface

`GRM` also includes a `node` interface, which works the same way as the [CLI](#cli). All of the available [options](#common-options) are the same, and the interface can run any of the [commands](#sub-commands). For example:

```js
const grm = require('gh-release-manager');

grm('download', {
  keep: 'releases',
  lib 'lib/module.js'
  repo: 'justinhelmer/gh-release-manager'
  top: 5,
  verbose 2
});
```

It returns a [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html) promise, for easy `async` support and error handling, i.e.:

```js
const grm = require('gh-release-manager');

const options = {
  keep: 'releases',
  lib 'lib/module.js'
  repo: 'justinhelmer/gh-release-manager'
  top: 5,
  verbose 2
};

grm('download', options)
  .then(function() {
    console.log('success!');
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error(err);
  })
  .done();
```

## CLI adapter

`GRM` also includes a [CLI adapter](#cli-adapter) to easily integrate the [node interface](#node-interface) into any exiting `node`-based command-line program. It uses [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/) to create a command-line program that integrates with the `GRM` [node interface](#node-interface) and exposes only the desired options.

### grm.cli(command, description[, grmOptions])

#### command

_{string}_ The `GRM` [command](#sub-commands) to run.

#### description

_{string}_ The description of the interface, which is displayed with the help documentation, i.e. `foo help [command]`.
 
#### grmOptions

_{object}_ An array of _{string}_ values representing which [options](#common-options) to expose. Should use the [short option format](#short-option-format), with the dash (`-`) omitted. By default, `o`, `q`, and `v` (for [--opts](#opts), [--quiet](#quiet), and [--verbose](#verbose)) are always exposed, so there is no need to supply them. 
 
For example:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
(function() {
  'use strict';
  
  const grm = require('gh-release-manager');
  const desc = 'Download the top <t> recent releases for "foo/bar" project and store them in [k]';
  
  grm.cli('download', desc, ['t', 'k']);
})();
```

When using the `CLI adapter`, `GRM` will always check for a [grm.opts](#grmopts) file. This way, a custom command-line program can specify project-level defaults for [options](#common-options), and expose _only_ the options that should be configurable by the program consumer.

## Common options

Options can be specified via the `CLI` or through the `node` interface. In either case, the options are the same.

The only exception is that `CLI` args (as well as [grm.opts](#grmopts)) use `kebab-case` while the `node` interface accepts args in `camelCase` format (i.e. `url-base` for the `CLI` vs. `urlBase` for the `node` interface). This is to match the conventions of the respective constructs.

Several of the options are `common` across the [sub commands](#sub-commands).

#### opts

_{string}_ The path to an optional [grm.opts](#grmopts) file. `CLI` args take precedence.

**used by:** [all sub commands](#sub-commands)

#### build

_{string}_ The path to a module that runs custom `build` operations _before_ running the build operations included by `GRM`. The module should return `false` to prevent the remaining `build` operations from running, without throwing an error or stopping the pipeline.

Alternatively, a promise can be returned that if fulfilled with the boolean value `false` will prevent the remaining build operations from running.

**used by:** [_build_](#grm-build1), [_release_](#grm-release1)

> Can use [vinyl-tasks](https://github.com/justinhelmer/vinyl-tasks) for running streaming operations easily.

#### deploy

_{boolean}_ Skip the [deploy](#grm-deploy1) step during [release](#grm-release1) (i.e. perform a _"dry run"_) by setting this to `false`. Defaults to `true`.

**used by:** [_release_](#grm-release1)

> Since the default behavior of [release](#grm-release1) is to [deploy](#grm-deploy1), the `CLI` accepts a `--no-deploy` flag instead of using `--deploy false`.
 
#### force

_{boolean}_ Force push to `gh-pages` during deployment.
 
**used by:** [_deploy_](#grm-deploy1), [_release_](#grm-release1)
 
By default, the `deploy` command will _not_ **force push** to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Set this option to `true` to reverse that behavior.
 
#### keep

_{string}_ The path to where releases should be stored. If this option is not set, downloaded files will be deleted when the process exits, whether it succeeds or fails.

**used by:** [_download_](#grm-download1), [_jsdoc_](#grm-jsdoc1), [_release_](#grm-release1)

#### lib

_{string}_ The relative path to the file to parse for `JSDoc` headers; assumes the same relative path for all releases. If not set, `[project root]/index.js` is assumed.

**used by:** [_download_](#grm-download1), [_jsdoc_](#grm-jsdoc1), [_release_](#grm-release1)

#### port

_{string}_ The port number to launch a development server using [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/). If not set, `[project root]/index.js` is assumed.

**used by:** [_serve_](#grm-serve1)

#### quiet

_{boolean}_ Suppress all output (`STDOUT` and `STDERR`). Defaults to `false`.

**used by:** [all sub commands](#sub-commands)

#### repo

_{string}_ The repository to fetch releases for (in the format `org/repo`) via the [GitHub Tags API](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/tags/). If not set, will be prompted to enter it.

**used by:** [_deploy_](#grm-deploy1), [_download_](#grm-download1), [_release_](#grm-release1)
 
#### top

_{number}_ The number of recent releases to fetch. Without specifying, will grab the default amount (determined by the `GitHub API`).

**used by:** [_download_](#grm-download1), [_release_](#grm-release1)

#### urlBase

_{string}_ The base used to [serve](#grm-serve1) the website. Also passed as `metadata` to the `Handlebars` templates during [build](#grm-build1).

**used by:** [_build_](#grm-build1), [_release_](#grm-release1), [_serve_](#grm-serve1)

#### verbose

_{mixed}_ Show more output. Can be `true`, `false`, or a number to specify the _verbosity level_. Defaults to `false`.

**used by:** [all sub commands](#sub-commands)

### grm.opts

Additionally, a path can be provided using `opts` to point to a configuration file for parsing.

If `opts` is not provided, `GRM` will look in the _current working directory_ for a file called `grm.opts`.

The `grm.opts` file should be in the following format (example `grm.opts` file):

```
--build lib/build.js
--force true
--keep releases
--lib lib/module.js
--port 8000
--quiet false
--repo justinhelmer/gh-release-manager
--top 5
--url-base /gh-release-manager.github.io
--verbose 2
```

> The `grm.opts` file must use the _long_ format of the option, not the _short_ format (i.e. `-d`, `-k`, etc. **will be igored**).

### Short option format

For less typing. Only works with the [CLI](#cli-interface) interface and for exposing [options](#common-options) using the [CLI adapter](#cli-adapter).

| Long | Short |
| --- | --- |
| _--opts_ | **-o** |
| _--build_ | **-b** |
| _--no-deploy_ | **-n** |
| _--force_ | **-f** |
| _--keep_ | **-k** |
| _--lib_ | **-l** |
| _--port_ | **-p** |
| _--quiet_ | **-q** |
| _--repo_ | **-r** |
| _--top_ | **-t** |
| _--urlBase_ | **-u** |
| _--verbose_ | **-v** |

## Custom build tasks

If there are additional `build` steps that need to happen outside of what `GRM` provides out-of-the-box, or any pre-conditions that need to be run before executing the build, use [options.build](#build).

This will allow the execution of any arbitrary functionality, such as running additional operations using [vinyl-tasks](https://github.com/justinhelmer/vinyl-tasks). It also provides the ability to stop the build from running.
